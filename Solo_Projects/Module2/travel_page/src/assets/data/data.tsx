Our community is diverse, but united in our determination to protect the awe-inspiring natural and cultural environments that surround us. After all, everything in Tofino is connected: from the kelp in the Pacific Ocean, to the black bears of the rainforest, to the people who call this place home. This is how we thrive.",
